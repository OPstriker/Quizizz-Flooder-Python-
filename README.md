# Quizizz-Flooder-Python-
A simple Flooder that Works only with Chrome, will also require a IDE or a Code Editor (I used Visual Studio Code)
## About
This is a Flooder that works only with selenium and ChromeDriver. This will not be Helpful unless you have an idea about how python or how Selenium works.
This is also a test Model so Don’t expect it to be the best only 1 bot per 5 secs or less (Depends on your internet and Computer).
## How to Setup?
It’s easy, Just download one of the python files and then make sure you have 
Chromedriver in "C:\Program Files (x86)" or change the PATH in the Program/Script (Python File).
The Link-Based one will require a link, which you will find when you’re at the Enter Name/Enter game Menu.
